## Detection of Abusive Messages on ChatApp using Machine Learning
<br>
We proposed a methodology to detect the most common type of social media crimes such as Cyberbullying.  Various Machine Learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Random Forest,
Linear Regression, and SVM Classification techniques are applied.The sender is termed as bully if any bullying is done by him and the receiver becomes victim. The sender will send message through chat app if the message is
found to be abusive it will show alert to sender himself but if the message is not abusive it will directly send to the receiver.
